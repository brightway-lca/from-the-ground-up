    "Brightway is a set of libraries (I like the term framework) that handles these different perspectives. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `bw2io` is based around the idea of documents - reading, converting, and exporting datasets as documents.\n",
    "* `bw2data` is based around graphs. It uses SQLite as a relational database, and has two tables: Nodes and edges. It is very flexible on how you chose to model these nodes and edges, but comes with a default set of assumptions.\n",
    "* `bw2calc` has a deep love affair with matrices - all kinds of matrices, it doesn't judge, it just helps you build matrices and solve different problems. It does come with a default formulation for LCA math, given in the equation above, but this can be extended in many different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start working with Brightway by using `bw2calc` and its life partners, `bw_processing` and `matrix_utils`. This is the easiest part of LCA, the theory of how our models should work, before we need to explore the horrors of... *reeeaaaaaal wooorrrrrrllld daataaaa (scary ghost noises)*. Let's go to the next notebook."
