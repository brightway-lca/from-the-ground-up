    "A [topology](https://postgis.net/docs/Topology.html) is useful because it comes with guarantees of consistency, as each edge is only stored once. This allows us to do GIS operations using set algebra with the ids of topological faces. Here is an part of the world, as provided in `Constructive Geometries`:\n",
